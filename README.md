# Friday

A personal AI for Tanav.

## CLI

This repo now includes a simple, good-looking CLI powered by Typer + Rich.

Install deps and run:

- Ask once: `friday ask "what's the time?"`
- Chat: `friday chat` (Ctrl+C to exit)
- Listen (voice): `friday listen`
- Todos: `friday todo list | add "task" | remove 1`

You can also enable TTS with `--speak` in `ask` and `chat`.
